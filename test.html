                    <h3>Gameplay Programmer</h3>
                    <p>As a passionate hobbyist game developer, I immerse myself in creating games that ignite my creativity. This journey has honed my problem-solving abilities and provided me with a deep insight into game mechanics, design, and coding. Being self-taught, I've delved into various facets of game development, spanning programming, graphics, sound design, and user experience, utilizing tools like Unity, Unreal, and Godot. My projects showcase my capacity to work autonomously, handle timelines effectively, and swiftly adapt to new technologies â€” all of which are transferable skills crucial in software development and creative troubleshooting across diverse domains.</p>

                    <h3>BSc Computer Science Student</h3>
                    <p>As a student pursuing a BSc in Computer Science, I have developed a solid understanding of fundamental computing concepts including algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles. My courseworks and practical projects have provided me with valuable experience in multiple programming languages, system design, and problem-solving strategies. This academic foundation perfectly complements my deep enthusiasm for game development, offering me a structured approach to coding, debugging, and optimizing software. Furthermore, my involvement in collaborative projects alongside other departments such as the Computer games design and technology, has honed my teamwork and communication skills, preparing me to confidently tackle complex technical challenges in academic and professional settings.</p>
